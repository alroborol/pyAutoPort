## Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a positive and inclusive community environment.

Be respectful and considerate in your interactions with other contributors. Avoid offensive language and behavior.

## How Can I Contribute?

We welcome contributions in various forms! Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting an enhancement, contributing code, or improving documentation, your input is valuable.

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please follow these steps:

1. Check the existing issues to see if the bug has already been reported.
2. If not, open a new issue, providing detailed information about the bug, including steps to reproduce.
3. Maintainers will label acknowledged bugs with 'bug' and duplicate issues with 'duplicate.'

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have ideas for enhancements or new features, please:

1. Check the existing issues to ensure your suggestion hasn't been made.
2. If not, open a new issue, describing your enhancement idea and the use case it addresses.
3. Maintainers will label acknowledged enhancement with 'enhancement' and duplicate issues with 'duplicate.'

### Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions! To contribute code:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and submit a pull request to the `develop` branch.

### Documentation

Improvements to documentation are always appreciated. If you find areas that need clarification or additional information, please submit a pull request.

## Development Setup

Developing doesn't require any specific setup at the moment.
We will create a [DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md](DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md) when development setup becomes necessary.

## Commit Guidelines

Please adhere to our [commit guidelines](COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md) when making changes. This ensures a clear and organized version history.

## Code Review

All contributions go through a code review process. Be open to feedback and address comments as needed. Once approved, your changes will be merged.

## Community and Communication

Join our community chat at Github Discussion for discussions, support, and collaboration. We appreciate your input and encourage active participation in the community.
